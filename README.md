# **TextNexus**  
_A Multi-Model AI System for Advanced Text Processing and Transformation_

## **Overview**  
TextNexus is an open-source, locally deployable text generation and transformation system designed for privacy-first, offline-capable operation. It supports various types of text manipulation â€“ such as paraphrasing, summarization, masked word prediction, and chat-style dialogue â€“ using a modular architecture that integrates both local AI models and optional external LLM APIs.

TextNexus is built with a **multi-access architecture**, ensuring usability **both through a graphical user interface (GUI) and via a robust API**, making it a **versatile solution** for developers, researchers, and enterprise applications.

The system is optimized for deployment on user machines or internal organizational servers, ensuring that sensitive data remains under full local control.

## **System Architecture**  
TextNexus is built as a **multi-component system** that integrates **various NLP models and external AI services**, facilitating **adaptive text processing** through a combination of:  

- **Pretrained AI Models** (GPT, BART, BERT, DeepSeek, etc.)  
- **Paid Large Language Model APIs** for enhanced capabilities  
- **A database-backed memory system** for persistent context retention  
- **Dynamic model linking** to refine and optimize text transformation  
- **REST API & UI interfaces** for broad accessibility and ease of use  

This **interoperable framework** allows TextNexus to be employed in diverse **text-based AI applications**, from **automated content generation and data augmentation to advanced linguistic analysis**.

TextNexus is structured for future extensibility and built with components like SQLite, Flask, and HuggingFace Transformers to support both experimentation and production use.
